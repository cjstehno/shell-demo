# shell-demo

This is just a dump of the sample code I worked up while doing my Spring Boot Remote Shell talk at the [Dallas Fort Worth Groovy/Grails User Group](http://dfw2gug.org) - [March 2016](http://dfw2gug.org/blog/2016/march-2016.html).

The original blog post that the talk is based on can be found here: http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/2015/spring-shell.html

Enjoy!
