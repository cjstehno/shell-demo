# shell-demo

This is just a dump of the sample code I worked up while doing my Spring Boot Remote Shell talk at the Dallas Fort Worth Groovy/Grails User Group - March 2016.

The original blog post that the talk is based on can be found here: http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/2015/spring-shell.html

Enjoy!
